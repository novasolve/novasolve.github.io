Let me find that document about Shitej first:
Ran tool
Read file: /Users/sebheyneman/Documents/nova_demo_processed/SHITEJ_MESSAGE.md
Now let me create both messages for you:

## ðŸ“± Message for Joe (Text):

```
Hey Joe! Our website just went live at https://novasolve.github.io and you can try Nova Solve now if you want. 

If you have brew installed:
brew install novasolve/novasolve/nova

Then just run: nova solve any_failing_test.py

Thanks again for offering to share the Loom with your team - really appreciate it! ðŸŒŸ
```

## ðŸ’¬ Message for Kshitij (Facebook):

```
Hey Kshitij! Been thinking about the Day Zero days lately - can't believe it's been this long since we caught up. Hope Orb is crushing it âœ¨

Quick update: Nova Solve just went live! You can actually install it now:

brew install novasolve/novasolve/nova

Website: https://novasolve.github.io

Remember that Loom I sent? (https://www.loom.com/share/0aab033e3fc54e15b31d95a4ec8bab74) - that's all real now. Nova spots bottlenecks, patches them, and ships PRs autonomously.

Would love to hear what you think - especially given all the testing infrastructure you've built at Orb. Happy to help you test it on your repos!

Hope you, Alvaro, and the team are doing well!

Best,
Seb
```

## ðŸ“‹ Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Test Homebrew Installation (2 minutes)

Open a new terminal and run these commands exactly:

```bash
# Add the tap
brew tap novasolve/novasolve

# Install nova
brew install novasolve/novasolve/nova

# Test it works
nova --help
```

If you see the Nova help message, it's working! âœ…

### 2. Fix Landing Page Quote (1 minute)

The landing page has a stray quote at the bottom. Let's remove it:

```bash
cd /Users/sebheyneman/novasolve-launch

# Open the file and remove the quote at the very bottom
# Look for a single " character near the end and delete it
```

I'll fix it for you right now...

### 3. Create a Demo Test File (2 minutes)

Create a simple test to demonstrate Nova:

```bash
cd ~
mkdir nova-demo
cd nova-demo

# Create a broken test
cat > test_math.py << 'EOF'
def add(a, b):
    return a - b  # Bug: should be addition

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0
    assert add(0, 0) == 0
EOF

# Test Nova on it
nova solve test_math.py
```

### 4. Update DNS for joinnova.com (5 minutes)

1. Log into your domain registrar (GoDaddy/Namecheap/etc)
2. Add these DNS records:
   - Type: A
   - Name: @ (or leave blank)
   - Value: 185.199.108.153
   - TTL: 600

   - 185.199.109.153
   - 185.199.110.153

3. Add CNAME record:
   - Type: CNAME
   - Name: www
   - Value: novasolve.github.io
   - TTL: 600
